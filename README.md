# HackItApartExtension
## Created as a part of the LCW_ACM Hack It Apart Hackathon
We had around 10 hours to create a project on the topic of Online Education

## Our Idea
This solution is aimed at students in elementary and middle school but could be expanded to work for high school and college students.

We saw that the education field uses a lot of different softwares on the both the teacher, the student, and the parent end of things which can make things really disjointed and confusing. The switch to online learning has also caused a lot of new stuggles for everyone: teachers, students, and teachers.

We decided to create an extension, for easy implementation, that each role (teacher, students, and parents) can use that creates google calendar events. This allows both the students and parents to be completely aware of when things are due or happening. Parents can help keep their children accountable and the children can have more tools to learn how to keep themselves accountable.

Other features we wanted to implement:
- positive reinforcement tactics to help the students find habits that work for them
- give a quick way for teachers to give announcements to students and parents
- create a to do list and timer for the students to better keep track of what they need to do
- ability to send reminders to students about up coming deadlines
- display tips and tricks for productivity

Future more complex feature we were hoping for:
- accessibility features that could change font, font size, color contrast, text-to-speech and speech-to-text
- algorithm that could detect if the student is struggling on an assignment or test and suggest to send an email to the teacher with an accomodation that would help
- algorithm that could detect possible bias in the readings, assignments, or tests and alert the teacher
- phonetic spell-check

## Where we ended up
We had issues with authentication via the extension and issues getting the javascript for some of features to work in the extension itself. 

Our attempt to circumnavigate the authentication problem is creating three separate extensions, one for each role. However, we were not able to configure the layout for the seperate extension in time.

Our attempt to circumnavigate the javascript issues was to first implement the features in a JSFiddle file that we could all collaborate on.
